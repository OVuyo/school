𝑐𝑡= 𝛼0 −𝛼1(𝑖𝑡−𝜋𝑡
𝑒) + 𝛼2𝑦𝑡+ 𝜖𝑡, 
 
where 𝑐𝑡 is the log form of household real consumption, 𝑦𝑡 is the log form of household 
disposable income, and 𝑖𝑡 is the nominal short or long-term interest rate,  𝜋𝑡
𝑒 is the 
expected inflation.  
 
Question 1: Use what you have learned in Chapter 15 of the Olivier-Blanchard-Macroeconomic textbook (OVuyo/school/Macroeconmics_data/Macroeconfull_pdfs.txt) and the existing literature to extend equation (1) to include possible missing 
variables. 
 
Question 2: Use what you have learned in macroeconomics and the existing literature to 
explain the expected signs of the parameters of the extended equation in question (1). 

 
Question 3: Choose a country of interest and collect quarterly data on the variables in 
the extended equation for the period 1995Q1 to 2024Q4.(i picked usa)
 
Question 4: Transform your data to match the variables in your equation. Estimate the 
extended equation using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method. 
 
Question 5: Interpret the estimated parameters and compare their signs to the predicted 
signs in question (2). Are the parameters estimated in line with the estimates in the 
existing literature? 
 
Question 6: Can your results be used to formulate policies in your chosen country?
