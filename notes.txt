week2:The nature and evolution of development economics: theories of development
Overview

We know that development is possible, but not inevitable. We have had a wealth of experiments. There are clearly no sure-fire formulas for success; if there were, there would be more successes. Some strategies seem to work for a while and then stall; some strategies seem to work in some countries and not in others. Economic theory has evolved to account for the successes and failures. The two lectures explore these changes in economic theory—both in the kinds of models used and in the factors that are identified as playing key roles. It focuses on two pivotal questions: What forces can explain the divergence in incomes across countries? What implications can we draw for the nature of the interventions most likely to promote development?

week3:lobalisation, Trade and Industrial Policy
Overview

The topic will focus on issues at the intersection of globalization, trade and industrial policy in South Africa. Overall, the section will provide a political economy analysis of these issues using both theoretical as well as empirical understanding of topics relating to the changing landscape and character of the global economic system in general and particularly in relation to the Global South, international financial flows and investment liberalization, international trade and trade policy, industrial policy and industrialization in the South African context. The first lecture will aim to provide a critical overview of main strands in trade theory applied to developing countries, e.g. comparative advantage models /new trade theories/classical and neoclassical trade theories and the policy implications. In the second lecture a conceptual and empirical understanding of the international institutions of trade and financial markets for development will be discussed. This is supplemented by providing insights into the structural trends, export-import structures, determinants and impact of international trade and investments in South Africa. The linkages and complex relationship between trade, growth and development as well as the various economic debates relating to globalization will be discussed, with a particular emphasis on the South African industrial sector.

week5:The Political Economy of South Africa
Overview

These lectures help to explain contemporary South African economic phenomena by understanding the structure and functioning of the South African economy. We begin with an overview of South African economic development. From there we explore two critical debates: what was the relationship between race, class, apartheid and capitalist development in South Africa; and how should we best make sense of the structure of the South African economy. In each case we begin with present day realities and then show how understanding these political economy factors is invaluable to making sense of those realities. The classes will conclude with a group discussion.

week8:overty and Inequality of South Africa
Overview

South Africa is something of a paradox; On the one hand, it is one of the most unequal countries in the world, if not the most unequal. Half of all South Africans continue to live in poverty, and there is little to indicate that the poorest will see a reversal in their misfortunes in the coming years. Economic growth has stagnated, and inflation remains high relative to the developed world, while the unemployment rate continues to climb towards 30 percent. On the other hand, it has one of the most progressive constitutions in the world with a Bill of Rights that foregrounds expanded social and economic rights. It retains a robust and critical media, a vibrant civil society and an active and independent judiciary. It is a country that sits at the nexus of several competing, and possibly incompatible, forces: it is a small, open economy participating fully in international trade and finance; and its socio-economic situation requires radical policy action. In this session we examine the trajectory of poverty and inequality in post-Apartheid South Africa and ask why the country has been unable to meaningfully address either of these problems in spite of numerous policies designed to reduce poverty and inequality.

week9:The Political Economy of Labour Markets: Informality and Precariousness
Overview

The idea of dualism in the South African economy, characterised by a ‘first’ and ‘second’ economy, has come to dominate government thinking in recent years, where the ‘first’ economy is formalised and organised, and is structurally disconnected from a ‘second’ economy characterised by informality and precariousness. But how useful are these distinctions in understanding the South African economy in the 21st century? In this session we explore the evolution of the informal economy in South Africa, how we understand and measure it, and what implications this has for policy.

week10:he Political Economy of Labour Markets: Gender and Economics
Overview

Labour markets around the world, including in South Africa, have witnessed rising rates of female labour force participation in recent decades. However, persistent gender inequalities in the labour market remain. Women are typically less likely than men to find employment; when they find employment, this is more likely to be part-time work or in precarious, informal and low-paid work; and although gender gaps in education have narrowed or been eliminated, a persistent gender gap in earnings persists. In this section, we explore changes in the South African labour market from the perspective of gender; we consider the implications of enduring gender gaps in economic participation for the well-being of women and children; and we highlight how women’s involvement in the unpaid economy limits the nature of their participation in the paid economy.

week 11:fiscal policy seeks to balance three elements of macroeconomic policy: stabilisation, sustainability and redistribution of income. Choices about how to strike this balance are framed within external constraints (which are particularly salient in a small-open economy) and interact with a broader set of macroeconomic policies and political imperatives. Following the democratic transition in 1994, expectations of a post-liberation fiscal expansion in South Africa were proven wrong, as government acted to contain the deficit and stabilise national debt. Following a period of buoyant revenue and expanding budgets in the decade after 2000, the country once again faces a constrained fiscal position. Analysts remain sharply divided about the wisdom of government’s position and its consequences for growth, development and inequality. This reflects differing views on the nature of constraints that policymakers face, and the interests that policy serves. The lecture will briefly review fiscal theory and present evidence on the evolution of policy choices in South Africa over the last twenty-five years. It will seek to ask whether government has achieved an appropriate balance between stabilisation, sustainability and redistribution, and discuss the choices and constraints that government faces in the years ahead.
